# ER-SaveParser
WIP Elden Ring Save Parser written in JavaScript

**[Github Pages version](https://corgan.github.io/ER-SaveParser/)**

Feel free to make an issue and attach your save if you find some weirdness


EldenFlagScanner.exe is a tool that attaches to Elden Ring and scans the entire eventflag block for changes and outputs it to the console/log file.

**DO NOT RUN THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE EAC BYPASSED**

You can bypass EAC by creating a `steam_appid.txt` file in your Game directory with `1245620` as the file contents.
Run `eldenring.exe` directly, not through Steam.
You'll be in offline mode and can scan away.
